// Functional Programming
// In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.
// the core concepts of Functional Programming including 
// pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter()

// Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, 
// without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

// Functional programming is about:
// 1) Isolated functions 
//    - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
// 2) Pure functions 
//    - the same input always gives the same output
// 3) Functions with limited side effects 
//    - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

// Lambda Function (a.k.a Arrow Function / Anonymous Function)
// A lambda function is just a short, anonymous function, often written with => (arrow syntax).
// Lambda functions: All the arrow functions (() => ...)

// A first-order function is any regular function that:
//  - Does not take another function as an argument, and
//  - Does not return another function.
// prepareGreenTea() and prepareBlackTea() are first-order functions.
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

// A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.
// getTea is a higher-order function because it takes prepareTea (a function) as an argument.
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and then executed inside that other function.
// prepareGreenTea, prepareBlackTea is the callback
// Callback functions: prepareGreenTea, prepareBlackTea (when passed to getTea)
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);;

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);

// Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function 
//  to decide the invocation of that function. 
// You may have seen them passed to other methods, 
// for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

// They are functions that are passed into another function to be invoked later, 
// based on the criteria defined in the function.
// Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function 
// just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. 
// In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

// When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, 
// then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

// Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
// Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs.

// In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. 
// Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.
// Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. 
// A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.
// In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. 
// You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

// JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. 
// For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. 
// This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.
// Off By One Errors are common in imperative code.
// They happen when a loop iterates one time too many or one time too few. 
// This can happen for a number of reasons, but often it is because the comparison operator in the terminating condition of the loop is incorrect. 
// For example, if the comparison operator is <= instead of <, the loop will iterate one time too many. 
// This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
// using slice() instead of splice() to avoid mutating the original array

// Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming
// A side effect is any application state change that is observable outside the called function other than its return value. 
// This includes modifying any external variable or object property, logging to the console, writing to the DOM, etc. 
// Functions that do not have any side effects are called pure functions.

// A pure function's return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects. 
// This means that a pure function must always return the same result if the same arguments are passed in. 
// It also means that a pure function cannot modify any external state. 
// This is very important in functional programming.

console.log(" === Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming === ");
// In functional programming, 
// - changing or altering things is called mutation, and
// - the outcome is called a side effect. 
// A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.
// The global variable
let fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer(num) {
  return num+1;
}

console.log(incrementer(fixedValue)); // 5
console.log(fixedValue);    // still 4 (unchanged)

console.log(" === Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function === ")
// Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. 
// This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, 
// then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

// There are several good consequences from this principle. 
// The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and 
// it won't depend on anything else in your program.

// This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. 
// You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

// Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

// two distinct principles for functional programming:
//  - Don't alter a variable or object 
//     - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. 
//  - Declare function parameters 
//     - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

// The global variable

  // create a new array, don't mutate
  return [...bookList, bookName];

  return bookList.filter(book => book !== bookName);

console.log(" === Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array === ");
// use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. 
// Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.

// functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.

// It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and 
// return a function from another function. 
// Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, 
// which means they can be used like any other object. 
// They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

// The map method iterates over each item in an array and 
// returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. 
// It does this without mutating the original array.

// When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. 
// The first argument is the current element being processed. 
// The second is the index of that element and 
// the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

console.log(" === Introduction to Currying and Partial Application === ");
// Currying is a process in functional programming in which 
// we can transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions that take 
// one argument at a time.

// In other words, instead of taking all arguments at one time, 
// a curried function takes the first argument and 
// returns a new function that takes the second argument and 
// returns a new function that takes the third argument, and 
// so on, until all arguments have been fulfilled.

// The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires.
// Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.
// In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, 
// then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// example of currying
// 1. using nested functions
function curried1(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

// 2. using arrow functions
const curried2 = x => y => x + y

// Both of the above two curried functions can be invoked in the same manner as shown below:
console.log(curried1(1)(2)) // 3
console.log(curried2(1)(2)) // 3

const funcForY = curried1(1);
console.log(funcForY(2)); // 3

// Use Currying:
// use currying in specific scenarios where it adds flexibility, clarity, or reusability to your code.
// 1) When You Want Partial Application
//  - Partial application means pre-filling some arguments of a function to create a new function.
//  - Currying naturally supports this.
const cmultiply1 = a => b => a * b;
const cdouble1 = cmultiply1(2);  // partially applied
console.log(cdouble1(5)); // 10

// 2) When You Want to Compose Functions
//  - Currying makes function composition easier because each function takes a single argument.
//  - This is common in functional programming, especially with libraries like Ramda or Lodash/fp.
const cadd = a => b => a + b;
const cmultiply = a => b => a * b;
const addThenMultiply = a => b => c => cmultiply(b)(cadd(a)(c));
console.log(addThenMultiply(2)(3)(4)); // (4+2)*3 = 18
console.log(addThenMultiply(5)(10)(-2)); // (-2+5)*10 = 30

// 3) When You Want Higher Reusability
//  - Currying allows you to create specialized versions of general-purpose functions.
const log = level => message => console.log(`[${level}] ${message}`);
const errorLog = log('ERROR');
errorLog('Something went wrong'); // [ERROR] Something went wrong

// 4) When Working with Functional Pipelines
//  - Currying fits pipelines where functions are passed around as transformations.
//  - Example: array.map, array.filter with curried predicates:
const greaterThan = x => y => y > x;
const numbers4 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(numbers4.filter(greaterThan(2))); // [3,4]

// 5. When You Want to Avoid Repeating Arguments
// Currying can make repeated calls cleaner when an argument is shared across calls.
const greet = greeting => name => `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
const sayHello = greet('Hello');
console.log(sayHello('Alice')); // Hello, Alice!
console.log(sayHello('Bob'));   // Hello, Bob!

// When NOT to Use Currying:
// - When you donât need partial application or function composition.
// - When all arguments are always available at once.
// - When readability suffersâoveruse can make code harder for newcomers to understand.

// ð¡ Summary:
// Use currying when you want flexibility, reusability, partial application, or functional composition. 
// Itâs especially powerful in pipelines, higher-order functions, or when building general utilities that youâll specialize multiple times.

// partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and
// returning another function that is applied to more arguments.
